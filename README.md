# Blood Bank Management
### Abstract
Blood cannot be manufactured in factories. It can only come from generous donors. There is always a need for blood donors. Morden medical care, including surgery and medical treatment for many diseases, is not possible without the use of blood products. In the current system for fulfilling the requirement of blood, Blood Bank organizes blood donation camps. The donor can donate blood in donation camps and get a certificate for this noble work. <br>

A blood bank is a place where blood is collected from donors, typed, separated into components, stored, and prepared for transfusion to recipients. A blood bank may be a separate free-standing facility or part of a larger laboratory in a hospital. <br>

In blood banks, there are different kinds of employees like Managers, Receptionists, Doctors, and cashiers. The coordination of these employees makes blood bank complete. In todayâ€™s system, they have to manipulate everything manually. They need to keep a record of donors and patients who have donated blood in the past. <br>
